# Time_Management_System

These days I'm trying a new method of time management from **Alexander Alexandrovich Lyubishchev**, aÂ SovietÂ entomologistÂ andÂ philosopher. I believe you heard about the 10,000 hours theory, and he spent about 6 years to reach this level multiple times in so many different areas. He never stopped writing journals since about 1912 for a single day, even with 2 world wars and the death of his son. He did so much in his life that could be a sum of multiple lifetimes.

It's basically writing down the time you spent on each task, and adjusting strategies & learning from statistics of every week, month, year, even every 5 years.

Currently I'm writing everything in my Notion diaries and I wrote some codes to get key words of each line and calculate overall time on each task. Well, because I have so many things I want to do besides school stuff, and it's really clear that it allows me to do more things than before.

If you are always struggling with "where did my time go?", then this tool is best for you!

Also it's not really necessary to be extremely disciplined, for this tool is merely telling you where you spend your time,Â so it should be easy to get started.



**Updated Dec 14, 2024:**

I have made some progress on my time management project. The codes and functions are refined, and I also learnt how to run scripts on my iPhone so I can call Siri to add or end a time block at any time. It can't be easier to track time now.

However, the only issue now is many times I would forget about recording time when starting or finishing a taskâ€¦ Still need to work hard to handle that.



**Updated Dec 23, 2024:**

Again I refined my codes, and now I have better visualization of time data on different genres, and a calendar that shows me clearly what Iâ€™ve done each day!

I found that in the last week (not including the party) everyday I have nearly 10 hours of useful time, which is unbelievable in the past, even in my most productive days.

Well it's not possible to keep 10 hours of useful time every day, for I also need time to do housework, shopping, etc. But it truly made me having more time to do more.

However, for me time seems never enough because after I did more, I still want to spend more time to learn much more stuff ðŸ˜‚
